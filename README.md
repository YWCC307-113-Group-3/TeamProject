# Scenario

Marriott International is facing pressure to innovate and review the AI strategy for its hotel brands. Marriott is the second largest hospitality player in terms of market share in Singapore. The uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) among hospitality players in Singapore and growing consumer trust towards AI engagements over the past few years has created an impetus for Marriott to review its strategies. Government support as well as successful use cases of front-facing AI solutions such as chatbots (i.e., digital concierges), service robots and automatic check-in/out systems, creates a favorable environment for Marriott to evaluate its next steps. Should Marriott deploy guest-facing AI in Singapore? If so, which AI solutions, and for which hotel brand, should be implemented?

# Data Encryption
AI systems can use robust encryption protocols to protect sensitive guest information. Data is encrypted at rest and during transmission, making it challenging for unauthorized parties, including government agencies, to access the information without proper authorization.

# Access Control
AI systems can implement strict access control mechanisms. Only authorized personnel with a legitimate need to access guest data should be granted permission. This limits the potential for government intrusion.
Anonymization: Personal data can be anonymized within AI systems. Guest profiles and preferences can be stored without direct identifiers, making it difficult for the government to link specific individuals to the data.
